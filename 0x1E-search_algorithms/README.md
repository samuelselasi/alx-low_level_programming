# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
### `C` `Algorithm`
## Resources
**Read or watch**:

* [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
* [Space complexity (1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

### General
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu `20.04` LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the [Betty]() style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl]() and [betty-doc.pl]()
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are ***only*** allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like `strdup`, `malloc`, … is forbidden.
* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. 
You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). 
We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. 
Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search_algos.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
* `O(1)`
* `O(n)`
* `O(n!)`
* n * m -> `O(nm)`
* n square -> `O(n^2)`
* sqrt n -> `O(sqrt(n))`
* log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
* n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
* `…`
