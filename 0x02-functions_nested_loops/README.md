## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

**Learning Objectives**
	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

### Tasks
[0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c)
```
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

```
* The program should return 0

[1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c)
```
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
```
* Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code
